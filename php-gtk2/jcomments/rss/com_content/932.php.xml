			<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark, Sorry for the late reply. Recently there has been a huge influx of spam posts, and your post was buried among them. First, please bear in mind that not all PHP libraries can run within the Joomla framework. For each article, it actually run through many layers of complicated plugins, modules and components before it gets displayed in your browser. Sometimes there are conflicts between the underlying Joomla PHP core and your other PHP libraries. Second, in order to get more clues, you might want to turn on display_error and error_reporting in PHP.ini so that you can see the error messages displayed on the screen. error_reporting(E_ALL); ini_set('display_errors', 1); When you change the PHP.ini, you might need to restart your web server so that the modified PHP.ini is loaded. The error message on the screen should tell you what exactly might be the problem. Hope this helps. Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I've used DirectPHP for a few years... it's beautifully simple and convenient. I recently decided to use DirectPHP to make PDFs with TCPDF. If I put the following code in a file and run it directly on the server, it works fine, but within an article, it just echos the data. Any advice? require_once(JPATH_ROOT.'/libraries/tcpdf/tcpdf.ph p'); $pdf = new TCPDF('P','mm', 'A4'); $pdf->SetPrintHeader(false); $pdf->SetPrintFooter(false); $pdf->AddPage(); $pdf->Output('htmlout.pdf', 'I');]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Hieu, Think it's not possible to do echoing in real-time. Not sure if you understand the Joomla framework and how content plugins work. Joomla retrieves the article content from jos_content, then runs the content plugin. The content plugin gets the raw content and change the content depending on the tags in the article. Then we return the modified content to Joomla. Joomla may do some further processing (e.g. there might also be some other system plugins) and finally display the final content to the web page. As such, using commands like ob_start() won't work because in the plugin, the output are not going direct to the screen. Instead the outputs are stored in a variable to be passed back to Joomla. You might be able to achieve such thing by writing your own system plugin. But not with DirectPHP. Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[/kksou I figured it out. I was already using JCE Editor (it was installed with my joomla installation and the default editor. The solution: go to components -> JCD Editor -> Editor Profiles open the default profile go to editor parameters -> advanced set "allow php" to "yes". when editin and article, code now saves and displays in the code window. Side note: I created a separate profile in JCE for super users (I didn't want to give php ability to all users). I duplicated the default profile, set it for super users only (this is done on the setup tab after clicking on the profile). Cheers, Mark]]></description>

The code executed when the article is loaded on the front end, but if the article is loaded on the back end, it is empty (if I save the empty article, the code disappears). Is this normal?

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Doan, Happy New Year! No, if you understand how content plugin works, it simply grab any tags that correspond to all the content plugins, process these tags, and then display the final output of the article. These plugins are processed only once before the display of your article. As such, you cannot use DirectPHP (or any other plugins that allow you include PHP) to use ob_start() to echo real time value. If you want to achieve this, you have to write your own component and you will be able to achieve this. Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi kksou, I wrote you a couple of days regarding "DirectPHP problem with Joomla 3.8.0" I'm happy to say that the problem I described is not caused by DirectPHP, it's a bug introduced with Joomla 3.8.0; it was already acknowledged and fixed from the team, see https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/18066/files/e8e03290a90b46213e0f4ad890ef8bea1e8e0e5b, and it's due to double event firing. Following the directions in the given url it's easily fixed. Sorry for the misunderstanding :( Keep up the good work! Ciao Fabrizio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi kksou, DirectPHP worked fine before upgrading to Joomla 3.8.0. With this version, I found that it's "sending" php code twice - I verified this by printing $phpcode variable in your code, it displays (and executes) the code twice, so function declarations return error ("function already declared"), DB insert calls insert the same record twice, etc. Thank you for any hint Ciao Fabrizio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I've been using DirectPHP on my sites for years with no troubles -- as long as I remember to activate the plugin. :-D Today I upgraded to 2.5 (Joomla! v. 2.5.28), activated the plugin, set "no filtering" -- but I'm having problems. The page with the list of articles with PHP scripts won't load -- it's just a blank page. If I disable those articles, it loads just fine. I've checked everything I can think of. Having recently had some of my other sites hacked, I'm making sure this one is "up to date" -- but upgrading to DirectPHP 2.5 isn't working for me. I'm also using Jumi for less complicated scripts. Do these two play nice together? Thanks!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Marc, May I know what codes you're trying to run? You might want to list some codes here so that people have more clues to see where might be the error. Any error messages that you see on the screen (note: you might need to turn on error_display in php.ini to show the error messages.) I've also written an article How to debug PHP codes in DirectPHP: http://www.kksou.com/php-gtk2/Joomla/how-to-debug-php-codes-in-directphp.php You might want to follow some of the recommendations there to debug your PHP code.

			<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say a massive THANK YOU for writing and developing DirectPHP! With this I was able to write a simple script to access my Joomla DB to enable me to display the username of the latest person to register on my site. Also, thanks for keeping the 2.5 version up to date, my server was updated to PHP5.5 this week and I lost the use of DirectPHP, finding you have a newer version available was fantastic, it works! Thank you, and yes, I do know I should upgrade to Joomla 3 but it's a BIG complex site to migrate.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this great plugin. Works out of the box for me. I needed this because I need to migrate a php-fusion site to a Joomla platform. I created my own member- and instruments administration application, written in php. Now I can easily migrate it to Joomla. At the end there was a little problem with the tags. I saw that these are altered within the plugin. Please can you explain a little bit to me why this is done? For now I changed some coding in DirectPHP.php functions fix_str and fix_str2 and all seems to work okay.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Well, that didn't work out so well... ok, to continue on (and retype it all out): I'm trying to work with images to that I can use the following type of string: [img src="dailypic[?php echo date('d');?].png" alt="text"] Using square brackets instead of regular ones so I don't lose my comment again... I am using Joomla 3.1 with JCE for my editor (instead of TinyMCE). I copied down your date test above and can usually get it to display correctly (often Joomla will put in &lt; and &gt; which seems to break things - usually you can type over this and it will then take it... usually). When I get it to work, I can see your date code just fine and I can see the text which translates to "dailypic19.png", but I cannot seem to get this to translate the html and the php at the same time.

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Fabu, Sorry for the late reply, because I'm not sure if I can answer your question. If I understand correctly, you have some PHP site and you want to make this into a Joomla site. If this is correct, then I have to say that DirectPHP is not the right tool you are looking for. DirectPHP is a content plugin. As the suggests, it's for use within a Joomla article, when you need to add some PHP codes in a Joomla article. DirectPHP is NOT used for converting any PHP codes into a Joomla website. Hope this answers your question. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[hi kksou, pls don't think I'm stupid, but I've got a problem to implement your plugin into our version of joomla. I don't know what kind of joomla we use, but it's terrible. I'm looking for answers to show my php sites correctly in joomla, but the only thing that remember me... Hey this is joomla... is the sentence in adminpanel. "You're using Joomla 2.5" My biggest problem is, that joomla as you know it has nothing in common with the version I've found here. Not even root structure (folders and files). I hope you can help me to solve this problem. Many Thanks Fabu P.S. I also hope, that you can understand my bad english. I haven't been written a long tim in english.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, That's really strange, because I just tried installing it on a fresh install of Joomla and it worked fine. If you have some time, would you mind do the same - i.e. try set up a fresh install of Joomla and then install DirectPHP. See if you get the same error. This will allow us to see if DirectPHP works on your server at all, or if it's conflicts with some plugins. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

Once you've debug the code, you can then transfer the code back to your article. Regards, /kksou]]></description>
