			<description><![CDATA[Hi Duncan, Sorry for the late reply. Not sure if you have the problem resolved? Joomla is a very loose framework, so conflicts between modules and plugins are very common. I'm not familiar with the News Show Pro GK5 - GavickPro module. So I'm not sure where's the conflict. May I know which Joomla version are you using? Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hello kksou, First congratulations for this great product. I installed the plugin on Joomla 3.4.4 and it performs well, BUT I have a problem. My PHP code is running normally and the article requested is displayed, but the plugin (Shortcode Ultimate) inserted in Article refuses to work. It should display a video on Vimeo. I tried with others (AllVideos, etc.) and the problem is the same. Do you have an idea of the problem? Warm regards Pierre]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark, Would like to help. But I don't use K2 and not familiar with the internal table structure of K2. May I know how you use Include Content Item with K2 when you're using Joomla 2.5? By the way, I used this plugin for my own website. I thought it's quite useful, so I decide to share it with others via joomla.org. Did you try other plugins in joomla.org that might work with K2? Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, This is a very simple plugin that simply grab everything in the "intro" field and display it. So if your intro includes the intro picture, it will display it. If you do not want the picture to be displayed, then you have to move the picture from the "intro" field to the "fulltext" field. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, For the case that you've described, I think there are many other plugins in joomla.org that can achieve what you have in mind. What I need at that time is just a simple, super light-weight plugin that allows me to include a footer message to be displayed in every page of my article. I couldn't find one in joomla.org - all those are too complicated. That's why I wrote this plugin. I thought this would be useful to others too, that's why I decide to share this in joomla.org. I want a super light-weight one - that's why this does not check anything - it just displays the article indicated by you. There are many other complicated ones in joomla.org. I'm sure you can find one that suits your need. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, You said "Joomla says the calendar has the ID 677". So, from where did Joomla tell you the ID? If you take a look, I believe it's not from the Article Manager or jos_content (if you're looking at the mysql database directly). If it's not from Article Manager or jos_content, then it won't work with this plugin. This plugin will only include content articles. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, From the error message, "Warning >>> there is no article with id = 677" It means there's no article with ID=677. When you say "The link has ID 677", what do you mean by "the link". Note that this is a "Include Content Item" plugin - it's purpose is to include one content article into another. It can only include a content article. And the ID refers to the ID of that content article. To be sure, you can go into your backend mysql "jos_content" table to check if there's an article with ID=677. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, Thanks for the update. Glad it works now. Yes, when you see the tag appearing on screen, it means that the tags have not been processed at all. In this case, the first thing I'll look is to go to the Plugin Manager to make sure that it's enabled. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

The solution for me was as follows: modify /plugins/content/include_content_item/include_cont ent_item/include_content_item.lib.php * remove lines 159 if($lang!='') { till line 189 if ($use_default) { * change line 190 $query = "SELECT catid, title, introtext,`fulltext`, state" ==> $query = "SELECT sectionid, catid, title, introtext,`fulltext`, state" * change line 219 $link = JRoute::_(ContentHelperRoute::getArticleRoute($con tent_id, $r->catid, $r->sectionid)); ==> $link = JRoute::_(ContentHelperRoute::getArticleRoute($con tent_id, $r->catid)); Now the plugin works just fine! :roll: Kind Regards from the Netherlands, NL8]]></description>

There's one thing you might want to take a look. You might have entered everything into the Intro text area and nothing into the Readmore text area.

			<description><![CDATA[Hello there, I have trouble getting your plugin to work. I really hope you can help me, this plugin is exactly what I need. Someone else on this page commented about it, but I'm using a different version of Joomla and it is not clear to me how he did get it to work. The plugin installed succesfull, but when I insert a code (I've tried several different ones) it will not show a 'read more' button, but the whole text/article directly. Any ideas? I'm using Joomla 1.5.25; trying it on a fresh install is not an option (too many customizations, would take weeks to rebuild). Thanks in advance! -S]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Fabio, Thanks much for sharing the tips. By default, all plugins are processed sequentially according to the orders as listed in the Plugin Manager. So if you order the Include Content Item plugin before that of other plugins (e.g. put this as 1. DO NOT put as 0. And make sure the other plugins that you want to process is 2, 3 or bigger.) In this way, the article will be included first, then followed by processing by your other plugins. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

You should see something like this: if ($has_readmore && preg_match('/fadein=1/', $matches[2])) $output .= $this->add_jquery_lib(); 4) Comment this line by adding a # in front: #if ($has_readmore && preg_match('/fadein=1/', $matches[2])) $output .= $this->add_jquery_lib(); 5) Save and close the file. Reload the page to see if the plugin works ok now. The problem for your case is that jQuery is being loaded twice. The above comment is to make sure that jQuery is loaded only once by your template. The Include Content Item plugin will just use the jQuery from your template. Let me know if it works, ok? Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, I suspect it's due to conflicts with your Artisteer template. 1) The only way to ascertain this is to install a fresh install of Joomla somewhere on your site and then install only the Include Content Item plugin. This will allow you to test if the plugin works on your machine at all. 2) If (1) works, then try change the default template to your Artisteer template. If it now doesn't work, you know it's a conflict. 3) Check (or ask the author) if Artisteer template uses the jQuery library. If (3) is yes, let me know. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi I have tried your extension and for some reason have had no luck. I would like to use the fadein=1 feature but I have not been able to make it work. Here are a few details: Using latest version of Joomla, Artisteer template. I insert the syntax {include_content_item 61 readmore=1 fadein=1} What I see when I view the article is the intro text, a read more button (which is not my default), and all the text after the read more button. I have tried to use readmore='read more' and I still get the button. I have uninstalled and re-installed. I would appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks]]></description>

Put some CSS styles in your included article so that the z-position is the first in the layer. Try to ask one of your friends who are good at CSS, and they should be able to help you with this in less than 5 minutes. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, You do not need to create an article of ID=123. If you create a new article with ID=56, to include this article, you use: include_content_item 56 It's not necessary change the ID to 123. To make things clearer, you can try the following: 1) Create a new article. Suppose the ID of this article is 56. Put in this article a string such as "This is from article 56". 2) Create another new article. Suppose the ID of this article is 57. Put in this article the following: This is article 57. {include_content_item 56} Now load article 57. You should see the following: This is article 57. This is from article 56 Regards, /kksou]]></description>

Then in the Article Manager, you should be able to find the article ID associated with your new article (usually it's on the rightmost column). Just replace 123 with the article ID of your new article and the plugin should work. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, Yes, the current version of the include content item tests for only the status of published and unpublished. It tested no other fields. I thought by right when your article is in the EXPIRED or PENDING mode, the Joomla system should automatically set it to be in the unpublished mode (it makes sense, right), but apparently this is not the case. This plugin has been released for almost 4 years. And you are the first one with this request! If you have used some of my other plugins, you would know that most of my plugins are light-weight plugins. I prefer simplicity and less codes (e.g. the googleMaps plugin). There are many other competing plugins out there with a lot more features - but heavier codes and usually more difficult to use. Do you know a bit of PHP? If yes, you can modify the code to test the articles for EXPIRED or PENDING. Let me know if you need any help in this and I'll see what I can do. Regards, /kksou]]></description>

The problem is that Joomla has MORE STATES than published or unpublished. Are EXPIRED or PENDING and not displaying them, Joomla works fine but the plugin does display and that's not right. You can do a test by changing the dates on an article to expire. Regards]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, For those questions that I have the answers, I will always reply immediately. For your case, I didn't reply because I really don't know how to help you. If you take a look at the history, starting from v1.5.10 (for Joomla 1.5), the article will only be included if it is published. If you unpublish the included article, the article will NOT be displayed. I've just tested the plugin again. It does indeed test for whether an article is published or not. If it's not published, the article will not be included. I do not have access to your backend. There's no way I can do any debugging. That's why I didn't reply anything...
