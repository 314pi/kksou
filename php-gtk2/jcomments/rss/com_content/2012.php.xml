			<description><![CDATA[Hi Ester, There's not enough information given. So it's really difficult for me to guess where might be the problem. Sometimes it's due to the Google Weather server not running. It should be working again after a few hours, sometimes a couple of days. It could also be due to conflicts with some other plugins or modules that you have recently installed. One test you can do is to install a fresh install of Joomla somewhere on your site and then just the google weather module. See if the module is running ok. This will allow you to see if it's due to Google Weather server problem, or due to conflicts with your other modules or plugins. Regards, /kksou]]></description>
