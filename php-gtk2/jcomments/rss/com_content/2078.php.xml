			<description><![CDATA[Hi Jim, > Well, occasionally there are two copies of the directions shown, one above the other Do you mean when you go to the backend Extensions: Manage and you see 2 different entries there? Or do you mean the frontend where the maps and directions are being displayed? Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Yellowfuji, Due to the popularity of mobile phones, most websites are now using responsive design. Google SEO also penalize those websites that do not support responsive design. As such, in the latest version, the plugin now supports responsive design (through the use of CSS). You can try it on an iPad. In the landscape mode, the map and directions are displayed side by side. But in the portrait mode, the map and directions are displayed top and bottom. In the desktop version, you can also try changing the browser width to see responsive design in action. With the latest version supporting responsive design, there is now no way to "force" the display of directions to be top and bottom. It's automatically adjusted depending on the width of the browser / mobile device. Thanks for highlighting this. I will update this page over the weekend. Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, I had a previous version but trying that did not make any improvements. So I uninstalled all and reinstalled your latest versions and all is now working perfectly. Well, occasionally there are two copies of the directions shown, one above the other. Best regards Jim]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Jim, (1) In the previous version, I used a standard 2-column HTML table. The map goes on the left and the directions is displayed on the right. Due to the popularity of mobile phones, most websites are now using responsive design. Google SEO also penalize those websites that do not support responsive design. As such, in the latest version, the plugin now supports responsive design (through the use of CSS). You can try it on an iPad. In the landscape mode, the map and directions are displayed side by side. But in the portrait mode, the map and directions are displayed top and bottom. (2) The directions are entirely returned by Google. I did not do any formatting before displaying the directions. For (1), if you require the map and directions to be displayed side by side, you can use back the previous version, or you can change the code yourself back to using HTML table. Let me know if you need any of the previous version of the plugin, ok? Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>
