			<description><![CDATA[Hi Uwe, Please take a look at the article Ordering of Joomla plugins: https://www.kksou.com/php-gtk2/joomla-tips-techniques/ordering-of-joomla-plugins.php Try to change the order of plugin so that you process DirectPHP before the php-rgraph plugin. I think the current order is such that php-rgraph is processed first followed by DirectPHP. That's why the php-rgraph tag is not processed. Please give the above a try and let me know if it works. Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hello, i'm working with directphp in Joomla 3.9.1 now and it is working fine :-) . I use codemirror as editor, because tinymce is a pain with a lot of php code - if you want to paste or press the wrong button. :-) I use also php-rgraph which is a very nice tool to show my weather data graphically. :sad: I had to reinstall my server and got updates on joomla, and other plugins... Since that php commands do not work anymore within the {rgraph ....} tags ... E.g.: {rgraph ... ymin="" ... } is totally ignored. Any suggestions? Please help if you can. :-?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hello ! Just confirm your plugin works perfectly under latest Joomla 3.8.8 and PHP 7.0. Thank you ! The only very desired feature is to enable this plugin for specific categories IDs or specific article IDs. It would decrease a general article loading weight and increase the general safety. With hope to a next update ! Best regards,]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Sven, There's no way to fix anything if you don't know exactly what's the problem. So first thing first, you need to find out what is the error message. Joomla has no inherent debugging tool. So the only way is to enable error_display in PHP and see what exactly is the error message produced. Also DirectPHP uses standard eval() function. So you can also copy and paste the entire code into a standalone .PHP file and see if it runs from browser or command line. If it doesn't, you can see exactly what's the error message on the screen. You may also want to refer to the following article that I've written that contains more details: How to debug PHP codes in DirectPHP : https://www.kksou.com/php-gtk2/Joomla/how-to-debug-php-codes-in-directphp.php Hope this helps. Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi there, I am using your DirectPHP Plugin and it worked all fine so far. Thanks so much for providing this Plugin. However, I have no experienced a problem with PHP Mail function. Within an article I have implemented code to generate an email and send it out via Mail(). Once processing the script, nothing is happening. I am not receiving any error message, but an email has also not been sent. First I thought it could be a missing email address which I have taken out from an mysql table, but I checked this and the query worked fine and e-mail address ist correct. Do you have any idea what the problem could be? Just for your information: The DirectPHP Plugin is ordered before the Content - Email Cloaking. Many thanks in advance for your support.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hello Iddy, I am a longterm (very happy) user of "DirectPHP". However for getting data out of your database and embed them into articles, you may want consider my own Joomla extension jDBexport. This is a data reporting tool, where you define SQL queries in the backend, and receive the results as Excel documents (or embed them in just about any way you want). contact me if you like to know more... regards Ruediger]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, I'm using php direct in joomla 3 article to get data from database table. It pulls all the data correctly but there are joomla shortcodes that just display as shortcodes and don't convert. If I run the php outside of joomla and then copy/paste the page directly into joomla article the shortcodes work. Any ideas?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Vikash, The DirectPHP plugin is a content plugin. As the name suggests, it's for use within the Article component only (which is com_content). I wrote this plugin to run simple PHP commands from within an article. It's not designed to run in other components. The SP Page Builder is a different component by itself. It does not know all the plugins out there, and naturally it will not run DirectPHP plugin which is a content plugin. You might want to check with the developer of SP Page Builder to see if there's anyway to trigger content plugin from within their component. Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[What made me think that, is that the crash didn't happen for all PHP code. Depending on what instructions I added to the article, it would crash or not. That's what made me suspect: For a content string, what difference would it make if my PHP is calling echo or JFactory? None. Unless the PHP insertions are getting treated as code instead. But I may be wrong, of course. Just letting you know my thoughts on the crash.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, Thanks much for sharing this! It's strange, because no other users have encountered this before. You can try this on a standard Joomla template. Don't think by default the editor will run the plugins. DirectPHP is a content plugin. It should run only with content articles. In any case, this is still useful knowledge to know. It will benefit other users if they encounter similar situation. Thanks and Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi kksou, finally I wrote a fix myself that has solved the problem. At the beginning of onContentPrepare function I have added the following 2 lines: if( !JFactory::getApplication()->isSite() ) return true; This restricts PHP code evaluation to the site (and not the backend). So it seems that my intuition was right here: PHP was getting evaluated when saving the article! Hope you can fix it for next versions. And thanks for your help. www.knowledgeexplained.com]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hello kksou. I have tried changing editor, but the same happens. Even when I select "no editor", which reduces input to a text box. What happens is this: - I copy the text to the input box - I press save - The page becomes blank - I can still press "back" on the browser, and I get to continue working at the backend - If I go to the web and see the article, it displays and its embedded PHP worked as expected. If you need any more details, feel free to ask (maybe through email?)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, As a test, can you switch back to the default editor that comes with standard Joomla installation and see if it's the same problem. This will allow you to see if it's just CodeMirror giving the problem. Does CodeMirror has a forum? If yes, maybe you can post the question there. Maybe there are already some solutions for that.

			<description><![CDATA[Hello kksou, thank you for your plugin! I am having a weird problem with DirectPHP 2.5 under Joomla 2.5.7. I edit my articles at the backend, and for most PHP code, if I embed it in an article and press save, it makes the backend crash. However, the article was saved correctly: it displays on the web and the and the embedded PHP works right. I get the feeling that the process of saving the article is attempting to execute the embedded PHP snippets at that very moment, instead of just saving them as HTML or text. Could this be happening? If it helps, I am using editor CodeMirror (code only, no WYSIWYG).]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ I am also experiencing this problem. Is there a workaround? You can solve this by selecting "No Editor" in the Joomla General settings. Put the php-code in the article and save the article. Afterwards you can select TinyMCE again. But if you edit the page with php-code you must select "No Editor" again.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, Based on your description, looks like you've only installed the DirectPHP module. For the module to work, it needs the DirectPHP plugin available here: http://www.kksou.com/php-gtk2/Joomla/DirectPHP-plugin.php Please install the plugin and test the plugin by creating a new article and entering the PHP code in the article. (please follow the instructions as outlined in the article where you download the plugin). Once the plugin is working correctly, you can then test your code in the module. Please give it a try one more time and let me know if it works, ok? Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi kksou, this is a great tool, which works really good for me! I just have problems getting javascript working. The function need to be within and echo"", correct? Otherwise it displays the javasscript code, but doesn't run. How do I need to place the javascript code correctly in order to be recognized as such by phpdirect? And how can I call the functions? Thanks a lot! :roll:]]></description>
