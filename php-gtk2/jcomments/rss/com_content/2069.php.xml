			<description><![CDATA[Yeah, we still use Joomla 1.0 for our websites. We haven't bothered to update because I don't feel the need to fix something that isn't broke. (And I do check occasionally for RFI/LFI/RCE/etc issues) ;-)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[There are not many people that have the talent that you do... In this economy a lot of companies & people can't afford to change every time Joomla has a new version and pay someone to upgrade their site. You are doing a great job. I work for Adobe and integrate & design new technology. Sometimes I feel that my work is not getting recognized but you find a few people that "thank you" for the work that you have provided them and that is inspiring. What you have done is excellent! Hope you keep up the good work!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I'm also a big fan. Thanks for all the work that you do. I use joomla 1.0.15 and hope you could find some time to build a Google plus one button for joomla 1.0. I know it's a alot of work but I have been following you for years and really like your work. You are very competent and you provide great projects. I can't thank you enough. Thank you... :-)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi Dave and Sandy, Thanks for the encouraging notes from both of you. Yes, you're right, Dave. Looking at the log, there are still a significant percentage of users downloading the Joomla 1.0 and 1.5 versions. Guess I'll continue with Joomla 1.0 for a while. It's just that every time I roll out a new release (e.g. the recent googleMaps v2.5.19 update), I have to test the plugin for all 5 platforms - Joomla 1.0, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 2.5 - and maintaining the codes for all 5 platforms (each version has some subtle differences here and there) is becoming more difficult... Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I myself love what you create and look forward to what you have in the future for joomla 1.0. I made my website myself and really don't like Joomla 1.5x or version Joomla 2x. Thank you for all your hard work... Sandy]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I also think a lot of people have not seen this page. You have a good indicator of how many people have viewed your projects and downloaded them. Respectfully, Dave]]></description>
