			<description><![CDATA[Hi Brian, Yes, it's actually quite "scary" to see so many files being changed. But no worries, if you have a full backup some time before Dec 10, restore the whole site and update your Joomla to 3.4.6, it should be fine. Warm Regards, /kksou]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Just hand this happen to me, thought it was a small problem at first because I couldn't access most things in the back end, getting a 500 error, check the php logs and was getting "syntax error, unexpected ':' in \sidebars\submenu.php on line 101" So I check that guy out and see very similar lines of code to the ones you have showing for index.php, Google search it and get this https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/8741 So the first comment says your sites been hacked, So do some more searching and see some other people with similar problems, they said they just changed the file to the one on the Joomla Github, but I know that's clearly not what they used to change the files, So I run a windows search on my website for the files modified by date, and get about 20 files that were modified on the same date with the top being modified with those lines. The first two were different though which were cookiestest.php and defaults.php. default.php could modify other files..]]></description>
